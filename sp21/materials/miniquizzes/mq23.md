Suppose you are performing sign analysis on the following graph:

```
       --------
       |      |
       --------
        /    \
----------  ----------
| a = 3  |  | a = -2 |
| b = -4 |  | b = 3  |
----------  ----------
        \    /
    -------------
    | c = a * b |
    -------------
```

1. What is the most precise information you can determine about c?
1. What information will the sign analysis determine?
