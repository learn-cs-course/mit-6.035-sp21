# mq14

Suppose you perform reaching definitions analysos on the following CFG:

```
              ----------------
              | 1: x = 1     |
              | 2: x = x + x |
              | 3: i = 0     |
              ----------------
                      |
              ----------------
  --------->  | i < n        |
 |            ----------------
 |             /           \
 |   ----------------   ------------
 |   | 4: x = x * 2 |   | return x |
 |   | 5: i = i + 1 |   ------------
 |   ----------------
 |       /
  -------
```

1. What is the length of the bitvector that the analysis uses?
1. What are the final bitvectors that the analysis computes at the end of each basic block?
1. What are the GEN and KILL sets for the first basic block?
