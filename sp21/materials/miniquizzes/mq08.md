What constraints must be checked during semantic analysis of the following statements/expressions (assuming a simple typed language like Decaf)?

- Assigning an integer to a local variable: `x = 5`
- Loading an array value: `A[i]`
- Adding two local variables: `x + y`
- Assigning a method call result to a local variable: `y = foo(x)`
