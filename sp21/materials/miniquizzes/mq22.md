Consider the following CFG:

```
              ---------
              | a = 5 |
              | i = a |
              ---------
                  |
              ---------
 -----------> | i > 0 |
 |            ---------
 |              /    \
 |   -------------  ----------------
 |   | b = 6     |  | return a + c |
 |   | b = b * 3 |  ----------------
 |   | c = b - i |
 |   | c += 2    |
 |   | i -= 1    |
 |   -------------
 |         |
 -----------
```

Suppose that the only free registers available to you are %r10 and %r11.

1. Which web would you split in order to complete register allocation?
1. Provide a register allocation for the rest of the CFG.
