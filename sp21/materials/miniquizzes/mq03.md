1. How's the class going for you so far?

	- Are the lectures going too slow/too fast?
	- Where are you at with phase 1?
	- Are you encountering any points of frustration?

1. Consider the grammar:

	```
	E → E add_op T | T
	T → T mul_op F | F
	F → lbr E rbl | id

	add_op ::= + | -
	mul_op ::= × | ÷
	lbr ::= (
	rbr ::= )
	id ::= a | b | ... | z
	```

	Draw concrete parse trees for the following strings:

	- `x + y × z`
	- `(x + y) × z`
