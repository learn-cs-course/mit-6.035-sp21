Note: This miniquiz is for Wednesday's lecture. I'll upload each miniquiz the day before, but **we recommend that you do them during lecture itself** during the allotted time, so that it's fresh in your mind when we go through the solution.

**Instructions for submitting miniquizzes are [here](../handouts/01-miniquizzes.md).**

1. Consider the language of binary strings defined by the following regular expression:

	`(10)*01(10)*(0|1)`

	Which of these strings are accepted by this expression?

	- 10011
	- 0110101
	- 01
	- 1010010
	- 10011001

1. Give a regular expression which accepts the language of all binary strings which end in 0 and whose length is a positive multiple of 3.

1. Does the regular expression `(+|-) (0|1|...|9)* . (0|1|...|9)*` recognize the language of decimal numbers? Why or why not?
