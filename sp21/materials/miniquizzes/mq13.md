# mq13

For the basic block:

```
q = 3
r = 10
s = q + r
t = r + s
t = q
u = q + r
v = q + t
w = 3 + x
```

State which optimization was performed on the above block to produce the following blocks.

- ```
	q = 3
	r = 10
	t1 = q + r
	s = t1
	t = r + s
	t = q
	u = t1
	v = q + t
	w = 3 + x
	```
	
- ```
	q = 3
	r = 10
	s = q + r
	t = r + s
	t = q
	u = q + r
	v = q + q
	w = 3 + x
	```
	
- ```
	q = 3
	r = 10
	s = q + r
	t = q
	u = q + r
	v = q + t
	w = 3 + x
	```
