# Submitting miniquizzes

You will be given access to a `<kerb>-quizzes` repository after filling out the logistics form. Submit answers to the miniquizzes there.

For text responses, click on the corresponding file (e.g. `mq00` for miniquiz 0), click the "edit" button on the right side (shaped like a pencil), type in your answer, then click "Commit changes". The file you submit should not be blank. **If it says "Propose changes" instead of "Commit changes", check that you're committing to the correct repository, i.e. `<kerb>-quizzes`.** If you end up making a PR to the wrong repository, your submission will be public for everyone to see.

For non-text responses (PDF or PNG/JPG images), rename the file so that it starts with the mqXX prefix and has the right file extension. For example, `mq04_page1.png` is a valid name for a PNG image for miniquiz 4. On the website, click "Add file" (next to the green "Code" button), click "Upload files", upload the files, then click "Commit changes".

You can submit multiple files, even of different types, as long as they all start with the right prefix. For example, for miniquiz 0, you can have a text file called `mq00` and an image file called `mq00.png`.

If you use PDFs/images, please try to keep them small (i.e. <2MB or so). This shouldn't be a problem if you draw your diagrams directly in an image editing software like Paint (and keep the dimensions to around 1000x1000 or lower), but if you see yourself regularly uploading images from your phone camera, please compress them first.

One way to compress phone camera images is to open it up in Paint (or similar), crop to only the relevant region, and resize to 50% or smaller if it doesn't hurt legibility. While you're at it, it would be great if you could increase the contrast too.
